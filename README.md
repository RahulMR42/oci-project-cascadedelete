- All the associated resources within the DevOps project will be in to `deleting` state and won't be able to use further. At any point within the `72` hours, the deletion can be cancelled or individual resources can be deleted.

- Once the 72-hour window elapses and the Project and sub-resources are being hard deleted, the OCI Logging Configuration set up by the Project resource will also be deleted
- For a failed deletion the project status will move to the `Needs Attention` state.
- The act will emit audit events for cascade Delete success & failures for the schedule.
